    "## Our Task\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to compute the probability that someone has Diabetes given their height, weight, and blood pressure. We'll generate this data ourselves (toy data), plot it, learn a logistic regression curve using Newton's Method for Optimization, then use that curve to predict the probability someone new with these 3 features has diabetes. We'll use Calculus, Probability Theory, Statistics, and Linear Algebra to do this. Get ready, ish is about to go down.\n",

    "## What is Logistic regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is named for the function used at the core of the method, the logistic function. In linear regression, the outcome (dependent variable) is continuous. It can have any one of an infinite number of possible values. In logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values. Logistic Regression is used when response variable is categorical in nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logistic function, also called the sigmoid function is an S-shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1, but never exactly at those limits.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Where e is the base of the natural logarithms (Euler’s number or the EXP() function in your spreadsheet) and value is the actual numerical value that you want to transform. E is a really convenient number for math, for example Whenever you take the derivative of e^x (that's e to the x), you get e^x back again.  It's the only function on Earth that will do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression uses an equation as the representation, similar to linear regression. The central premise of Logistic Regression is the assumption that your input space can be separated into two nice ‘regions’, one for each class, by a linear(read: straight) boundary. Your data must be linearly seperable in n dimensions\n",

    "So if we had the following function\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cbeta_0+%2B+%5Cbeta_1+x_1+%2B+%5Cbeta_2+x_2&bg=ffffff&fg=555555&s=0&zoom=2 \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Given some point (a,b), if we plugged it in, the equation could output a positive result (for one class), negative result (for the other class), or 0 (the point lies right on the decision boundary).\n",
    "\n",
    "So  we have a function that outputs a value in (-infinity, +infinity) given an input data point. But how do we map this to the probability P_+, that goes from [0, 1]? The answer, is in the odds function.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/bz8XqI8.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P(X)$ denote the probability of an event X occurring. In that case, the odds ratio (OR(X)) is defined by \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac%7BP%28X%29%7D%7B1-P%28X%29%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=555555&s=0&zoom=2 \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "which is essentially the ratio of the probability of the event happening, vs. it not happening. It is clear that probability and odds convey the exact same information. But as $P(X)$ goes from 0 to 1, OR(X) goes from 0 to infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "Input values (x) are combined linearly using weights or coefficient values (referred to as the Greek capital letter Beta) to predict an output value (y). A key difference from linear regression is that the output value being modeled is a binary values (0 or 1) (discrete) rather than a numeric value (continuous)\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/ihcclogisticregression-130728061733-phpapp02/95/logistic-regression-in-casecontrol-study-14-638.jpg?cb=1374992365 \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are still not quite there yet, since our boundary function gives a value from –infinity to infinity. So what we do, is take the logarithm of OR(X), called the log-odds function. Mathematically, as OR(X) goes from 0 to infinity, log(OR(X)) goes from –infinity to infinity\n",
    "\n",
    "We are modeling the probability that an input (X) belongs to the default class (Y=1). The probability prediction must be transformed into a binary values (0 or 1) in order to actually make a probability prediction. Logistic regression is a linear method, but the predictions are transformed using the logistic function. The impact of this is that we can no longer understand the predictions as a linear combination of the inputs as we can with linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait, how is the boundary function computed? Well we want to maximize the likelihood that a random data point gets classified correctly. We call this Maximimum likelihood estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maximum likelihood estimation is a general approach to estimating parameters in statistical models by maximizing the likelihood function. MLE applied to deep networks gets a special name “Backpropagation\". MLE is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "L(θ|X)=f(X|θ)\n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's Method is an optimization algorithm. You can use this algorithm to find maximum (or minimum) of many different functions, including the likelihood function. You can obtain maximum likelihood estimates using different methods and using an optimization algorithm is one of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use Newton's Method for optimizing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Newton’s method usually converges faster than gradient\n",
    "descent when maximizing logistic regression log\n",
    "likelihood.\n",
    "- Each iteration is more expensive than gradient descent\n",
    "because of calculating inverse of Hessian\n",
    "- As long as data points are not very large, Newton’s\n",
    "methods are preferred\n",
