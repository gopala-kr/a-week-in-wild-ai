Challenges of DL:
 
- Big data analytics using Deep Learning
- Scalability of DL approaches
- Ability to generate data which is important where data is
not available for learning the system (especially for
computer vision task such as inverse graphics).
- Energy efficient techniques for special purpose devices
including mobile intelligence, FPGAs, and so on.
- Multi-task and transfer learning (generalization) or
multi-module learning. This means learning from
different domains or with different models together.
- Dealing with causality in learning.
